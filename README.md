# Terraform + Jenkins Learning Project

**Objective:**  
This project is a hands-on journey to learn **Terraform** and **Jenkins** by building a simple end-to-end CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to understand and implement **infrastructure provisioning, automation, and deployment** on Azure, step by step, while experimenting and learning every day.

**What I’m learning through this project:**  
- Provisioning Azure infrastructure with Terraform (Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, Subnets, VMs, Public IPs)  
- Automating deployment pipelines with Jenkins  
- Writing reusable and modular Terraform code using variables, main, and output files  
- Basic Linux server automation using shell scripts  
- Copying artifacts and deploying applications on cloud VMs  
- Understanding cloud networking and security basics  

**Project Structure:**  
- `terraform/` → Contains `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`  
- `jenkins/` → Contains Jenkins pipeline scripts and shell scripts for deployment  
- `app/` → Contains `index.html`  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

**Approach:**  
- Start small, implement one resource at a time in Terraform  
- Use Jenkins to automate build, deploy, and infrastructure provisioning  
- Learn by doing, experiment with changes, and refine continuously  

**Outcome:**  
By the end of this project, I aim to have a **working CI/CD pipeline** that provisions infrastructure on Azure, deploys a sample application, and demonstrates my understanding of **Terraform, Jenkins, and cloud deployment concepts**.
